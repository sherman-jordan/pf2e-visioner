### Improved

- **Cover Visualization Performance**: Limit computation to the current viewport (with small padding) instead of scanning large scene areas. Significantly reduces work when zoomed/panned.

### Fixed

- **Viewport Conversion Reliability**: Use `canvas.stage.worldTransform.applyInverse` for screen→world mapping in `getViewportWorldRect()` to ensure correct results across PIXI versions. Removed earlier manual inverse math.

## [2.0.1] - 2025-08-12

### Fixed

- Auto cover:
  - now works with and without roll dialog
  - now gets reevaluated on token movement
  - walls intersection algorithm tuned to better check
  - removed any and cross modes

## [2.0.0] - 2025-08-12

### Breaking - Full Internal Rewrite and Module Restructure

- Project reorganized and rewritten for clarity and performance.

### Added

- Auto Cover (reworked):
  - Applies cover only if the line from attacker to target passes through a blocking token’s space.
  - Lesser vs Standard cover determined by relative size (blocking token ≥ 2 size categories larger => Standard).
  - Applies pre-roll via modifiers dialog or strike click capture; clears cover immediately after the roll’s message renders.
  - Multi-side evaluation: checks all token sides for walls; tokens use center-to-center line for accurate blocking.
  - Intersection mode for token blockers: new setting “Auto-Cover: Token Intersection Mode” with choices:
    - Any (default): center line intersecting any token edge counts.
    - Cross: center line must cross both opposite edges (top+bottom or left+right).
  - Ignore undetected blockers: new setting “Auto-Cover: Ignore Undetected Tokens” (skip blockers undetected to the attacker per Visioner map).
  - Respect token flag: new setting “Auto-Cover: Respect Token Ignore Flag”; if enabled, tokens with `flags.pf2e-visioner.ignoreAutoCover = true` will be ignored.
  - New token setting in vision tab: ignore as auto cover blocker.
  - Wall-level toggle: per-wall flag `flags.pf2e-visioner.provideCover` (when false) makes that wall not contribute to cover. Default set to true.
  - New wall setting: ignore as auto cover.
  - Prone blockers toggle: new setting “Auto-Cover: Prone Tokens Can Block” (default on). If disabled, tokens with a Prone condition won’t provide cover.
  - Ally/dead filters: existing settings integrated into auto-cover token filtering (ignore allies, ignore 0-HP tokens).
  - Gated by setting and enabled GM-only to avoid duplicates.
  - Auto-Cover live recompute: cover now recalculates when attacker or target moves/resizes during an active roll flow.
  - Auto-Cover blocker options:
    - Any (default)
    - Cross (ray must cross both opposite edges)
    - Ray through token center
    - Ray inside ≥10% of blocking token square
    - Ray inside ≥20% of blocking token square
  - Wall-level toggle: per-wall flag `flags.pf2e-visioner.provideCover` to exclude walls from cover.
  - Token UI: Ignore as Auto-Cover Blocker flag in Token Config Vision tab.
- Take cover action support
- Grouped Settings menu (ApplicationV2), scrollable, localized labels, and reliable select persistence.

- Seek Template and Range Improvements (stabilized from 1.x):
  - Strict filtering by player template (no generic fallback template).

- Chat Automation Quality of Life:
  - Point Out excludes loot, pings target on Apply.
  - Sneak lists only enemies (no allies).
  - Hide prerequisites enforced (concealed or standard/greater cover) and “No changes to apply” notification when relevant.
  - Players don’t see Apply buttons in panels.

- API:
  - Bulk visibility setter to apply many observer→target updates efficiently.

### Changed

- No more world reloads for several settings; they are now applied at runtime:
  - Ignore Allies, Seek template toggle, Seek range toggles, player tooltip toggles, auto cover.
- Hook registration centralized under `scripts/hooks/` with small registrars; heavy logic moved to feature folders.
- Imports largely hoisted to top-of-file for maintainability; kept dynamic imports only where lazy-loading is beneficial (dialogs, heavy batches).

### Fixed

- Hide action now respects the Ignore Allies setting (allied observers are filtered out).
- Auto Cover reliably applies to the current roll and then cleans up; prevents lingering effects.
- Template-based Seek respects only targets inside the player’s template and opens faster via sockets.
- Token Manager batch operations reconciled effects reliably and reduced redundant document operations.
- Sneak integration showing up on sneak attack damage rolls.

### Removed

- Legacy/unused files and integration paths related to the old effects coordinator code.

## [1.9.0] - 2025-08-11

### Added

- Stealth for loot tokens: Added possibility to hide loot from specific tokens and finding them with seek!
- Stealth DC override for loot tokens in Token Config:
  - Injected a Stealth DC number field into the Vision tab for loot actors.
  - Added a dedicated “PF2E Visioner” tab fallback for loot tokens when available.

### Changed

- Seek and Token Manager now respect the token-level Stealth DC override for loot tokens, falling back to the world default when unset.
- Removed Cover and visibility integration, rules will now explicitly follor enforce RAW setting

## [1.8.0] - 2025-08-11

### Added

- API: `api.clearAllSceneData()` to clear all per-token visibility/cover maps and all module-created effects across the scene, then rebuild and refresh visuals.
- Macros added:
  - Clear All Scene Data (calls `api.clearAllSceneData()`)
  - Open Token Manager(calls `api.openTokenManager()`)

### Improved

- Effects handling: will now use batching for better performance

## [1.7.1] - 2025-08-11

### Changed

- Enhanced tooltip size customization: Improved implementation of tooltip font size setting

## [1.7.0] - 2025-08-10

### Added

## [1.5.1] - 2025-08-10

### Changed

- Matching color for dialog theme on highlight row

## [1.5.0] - 2025-08-10

### Added

- Token Manager: Replaced Effects column with DC column in the Visibility tab.
  - Target mode shows Perception DC; Observer mode shows Stealth DC.
- New world setting: "Integrate roll outcome in the token manager".
  - Optional Outcome column compares the last relevant roll to the DC and displays degree-of-success (Success, Failure, Critical Success/Failure).
- Selection-based row highlighting across Token Manager and all action dialogs (Seek, Hide, Sneak, Create a Diversion, Point Out, Consequences):
  - Selecting tokens on the canvas highlights matching rows and auto-scrolls them into view.

### Changed

- Moved effects descriptions into the Current State tooltip.
- Unified PC and NPC table widths; responsive colgroups when Outcome is on/off.
- Outcome chip style matches action dialogs.
- If Outcome is enabled, the manager widens on open to ensure the column is visible.
- Removed hover-based row→token and token→row behavior to avoid conflicts; selection now drives row highlighting.

### Fixed

- Correct DC tooltip text and header alignment.
- Layout glitches when Outcome is disabled.

## [1.4.0] - 2025-08-09

### Added

- Hover tooltips now show Font Awesome icon badges aligned above tokens:
  - Left badge: visibility state icon
  - Right badge: cover icon when applicable
- PF2e hud support for tooltip position

### Changed

- Hover tooltips no longer render text labels; icons are used for a cleaner, compact look.
- Badge positioning uses world-to-screen transforms, keeping alignment stable under zoom/pan.
- Create a Diversion discovery now considers both observed and concealed creatures as valid observers, and outcomes display only those who can currently see the diverter.
- Hide possible when token got observers and is concealed OR (has standard OR great cover)
- Effects will show token name rather than actor

### Fixed

- Token Manager: resolved ReferenceError for `pairs2` in target-mode apply flows.
- Tooltip cleanup reliably removes DOM badges to prevent lingering elements after hover/Alt/O.

## [1.3.3] - 2025-08-09

- Damage Consequences button is hidden when no outcomes exist and shown when at least one target qualifies.
- Token Manager/Visibility Manager: Reworked layout to a single outer scroll container; inner tables no longer create nested scrollbars.
- Sticky footer no longer overlaps content; center area flexes and scrolls correctly.

## [1.3.2] - 2025-08-09

## Fixed

- CSS class overrding default system one (sorry!)

## [1.3.1] - 2025-08-08

### Added

- New world setting: Integrate Cover with Visibility Rules (`integrateCoverVisibility`). When enabled, certain actions obey cover prerequisites. Specifically, Hide is only available if the acting token has at least Standard Cover from an observer.

### Changed

- Chat automation now hides the “Open Hide Results” button when no actionable changes are possible after applying visibility and cover checks (and the actual roll outcome when present).
- Hide observer discovery uses the same cover gating as the UI check to ensure consistency.

---

## [1.3.0] - 2025-08-08

### Visioner Token Manager (Visibility & Cover)

- Reworked Apply actions:
  - Apply Current now applies the active type (Visibility or Cover) for BOTH modes (Observer → Targets and Targets → Observer).
  - Apply Both now applies BOTH types for BOTH modes in one click.
- States persist reliably after changing type:
  - All map writes now merge into existing maps instead of overwriting.
  - Writes use `document.update({ flags... })` for stability.
  - Dialog refresh re-reads maps from flags on each render.
- Corrected table sorting per type (ally\npc):
  - Visibility order: Observed → Concealed → Hidden → Undetected.
  - Cover order: None → Lesser → Standard → Greater.

All notable changes to the PF2E Visioner module will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.2.17] - 2025-08-06

### Fixed

- **Point out dialog wrong application**: fixed condition(hidden\undetected) change for wrong token

## [0.2.15] - 2025-08-06

### Fixed

- **Major bug**: Had an issue that effect would go on the defender when attacking a condition(hidden\undetected) attacker, this is now fixed

## [0.2.14] - 2025-08-06

### Added

- **Combat Seek Range Limitation**: New setting to limit Seek actions to 30 feet range in combat, following PF2e rules

## [0.2.7] - 2025-08-06

### Added

- **Player Tooltip Setting**: New "Allow Player Tooltips" setting enables non-GM players to see visibility indication tooltips from their controlled tokens' perspective
- **Ignore Allies Setting**: New "Ignore Allies" setting filters visibility dialogs so NPCs only see players and players only see NPCs, streamlining visibility management
- **Shared Utility Functions**: Extracted common ally filtering logic into reusable utility functions for better code maintainability

### Fixed

- **Hide Dialog Encounter Filter**: Fixed bug where "Apply All" button in Hide dialog ignored encounter filter and applied changes to all tokens instead of only encounter tokens

### Improved

- **Code Organization**: Refactored all chat automation modules to use shared ally filtering utility, eliminating code duplication and ensuring consistency
- **Player Access Control**: Players can only see tooltips for their own controlled tokens when player tooltips are enabled, preventing information leakage
