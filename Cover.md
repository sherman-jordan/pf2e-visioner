# Auto-Cover
Visioner uses a performant and flexible ray-casting algorithm to determine cover between tokens. Cover is granted by wall segments and other tokens. Because RAW provides guidelines for how cover is determined, but leaves much to GM discretion, Visioner's algorithm is customizable through settings, and provides easy opportunity for GMs and players to make overrides on the fly.

The way Visioner Auto-Cover system determines cover between tokens is highly configurable. For more information about the settings available to customize the Auto-Cover system, [see here](Settings.md#auto-cover-settings).

## Manually Overriding Cover from Wall Segments
The `Advanced Wall Settings` menu within the Visioner specific wall options allows for cover granted by specific wall segments to be manually adjusted. 

For more information about using Visioner's tools to customize wall segments [see here](Wall-Settings.md).
